# pwned

Inspired by this computerphile video on [Have you been pwned?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhUb5iknVJs) which uses the 
[haveibeenpwned api](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2) to see if your password has been compromised or not.

Mike also has a [python library](https://github.com/mikepound/pwned-search) that uses the API to do the check. 

I created a bash script that does the same (with very few error checks) on a lazy Sunday afternoon.
